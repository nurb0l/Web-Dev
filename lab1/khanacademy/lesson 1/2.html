            Nobody’s born smart. <strong>We all start at 0.</strong> Can’t talk, can’t walk, <em>certainly can’t do algebra.</em><br>
            Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <strong>Nobody’s good at anything at first.</strong><br>
            There was a time when <em>Einstein couldn’t count to 10.</em><br>
            And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs <strong>just like the rest of us.</strong><br>
            Thankfully, <em>we are born to learn.</em><br>
            Slowly. Surely. <em>You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.</em><br>
            Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
            Until one day, <strong>you walk.</strong><br>
            One foot in front of the other. <em>One idea on top of the next.</em><br>
            <strong>Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.</strong><br>
            <em>Failing is just another word for growing.</em> And <strong>you keep going.</strong><br>
            <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
            It’s not that you don’t get it.<br>
            You just don’t get it, <strong>yet.</strong><br>
            Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
            are built on basic ideas that <strong>anyone, anywhere can understand.</strong><br>
            <em>Whoever you are, wherever you are.</em><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>You only have to know one thing:</strong><br>
            <strong><em>You can learn anything.</em></strong>
