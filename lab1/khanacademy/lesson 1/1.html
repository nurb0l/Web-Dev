        <h1>Whispers of the Wind</h1>
        <p>
            The wind whispers softly through the trees,<br>
            A melody carried on the gentle breeze.<br>
            It tells of secrets from the sky so wide,<br>
            And dances with leaves in a graceful glide.<br><br>
            
            It brushes the waters, calm and still,<br>
            Kissing the ripples with a tender thrill.<br>
            Its voice is a story, ancient and true,<br>
            Of nature's beauty in every hue.<br>
        </p>
